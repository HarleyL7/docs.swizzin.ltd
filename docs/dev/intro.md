This section is for those who would like to help us make changes to the dozens of thousands of running swizzin instances and improve stability, add features or make nice inside jokes in the code.

These docs tell you how to get easily started with a setup we know is fast, convenient and low-effort, how the swizzin structure is devised, and what things you have on offer to make it so that you re-use as much code as possible and make everything easier on yourself.

While this chapter is in development, please make sure to still refer to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md]() on our GitHub, which has a very condensed version of all of this.
