Calibre-web is a graphical web frontend for a Calibre Library with many very useful features, such as user management, on-the-fly conversion, Send-to-Kindle and Kobo Sync API.

## Initial Setup

Installing Calibre-web is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install calibre-web
```

This command will configure and install Calibre-web.

You will then be able to access it through either `http://domain.tld/calibre` or `http://domain.tld:8083`, depending on whether or not you have nginx installed.

### Options

import InstallOptsWarning from '../snippets/installoptswarning.md';

<InstallOptsWarning />

- `CALIBRE_LIBRARY_USER`:
  - Default: The name of the master user
  - Adds the dedicated calibre-web user to the group of this user
  - Used to infer possible calibre library path if not specified (see below)
  - Calibre-web's admin password will be set to the value of this user's password

- `CALIBRE_LIBRARY_PATH`:
   - Default
      - If exists, then: `/home/$CALIBRE_LIBRARY_USER/Calibre Library`
      - Otherwise unset, which will skip the library setup and password change procedure
   - Used to set up the calibre-web basic setup


## Post-install
1. Link to your instance of the Calibre Library folder
   - For example `/home/masteruser/Calibre Library`
   - _Note:_ If you installed calibre through swizzin, this step will be done for you
   - If you would like to add your existing library, you will need to give the `calibreweb` system user access to your library with these commands:
      - ```bash
      # Replace $theuser with the name of the user which has the library files
      sudo usermod -a -G $theuser calibreweb
      sudo chmod 750 -R /home/$theuser
      sudo chmod 770 /home/$theuser/path/to/library
      systemctl restart calibre-web
      ```
2. Change the username and password of the admin user
   - Log in to calibre using `admin`:`admin123`
   - Go to `http://<domain>/calibre/me` and change the details there
3. Link or install necessary binaries
   - Kepubify is installed in `/usr/local/bin/kepubify`
   - If you have `unrar` installed (`apt install unrar`), it will be in `/usr/local/bin/kepubify`
4. **Optional:** configure the direct Google Drive support
   - Please check [this article](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Configuration#using-google-drive-integration) for the appropriate steps
   - You only need to do this when you want to keep your entire library in google drive, not if you're using rclone etc.

## User management
Calibre-web has its own internal user database **which swizzin does not manage in any way**. Please manage your users through the web interface.

## Service management

Calibre-web runs as its own single process with its own system user.


The systemd service for calibre-web resides here:

```bash
/etc/systemd/system/calibre-web.service
```

You can use the following commands to manage the service.

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="calibre-web"/>

Please make sure to consult the [issues](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/issues) of Calibre-web and the [expansive wiki of the project](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki). 

### Verbose output
Calibre-web stores its logs in `/opt/calibre-web/calibre-web.log` and optionally `/opt/calibre-web/access.log`.

You can increase the verbosity of the log level by going to `http://domain.tld/calibre/admin/config`, opening the "Logfile Configuration" section and changing the level there.
