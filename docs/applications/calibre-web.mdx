Calibre-web is a graphical web frontend for a Calibre Library with many very useful features, such as user management, on-the-fly conversion, Send-to-Kindle and Kobo Sync API.

## Initial Setup

Installing Calibre-web is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install calibre-web
```

This command will configure and install Calibre-web.

You will then be able to access it through either `http://domain.tld/calibre` or `http://domain.tld:8083`, depending on whether or not you have nginx installed.

### Options

import InstallOptsWarning from '../snippets/installoptswarning.md';

<InstallOptsWarning />

- `clbDbOwner`:
  - Default: The name of the master user
  - Use this to allow Calibre-web to access the Calibre Library of someone other than the master user.

## Post-install
1. Link to your instance of the Calibre Library folder
   - For example `/home/masteruser/Calibre Library`
2. Change the username and password of the admin user
   - Go to `http://domain/calibre/me` and change the details there


## User management
Calibre-web has its own internal user database **which swizzin does not manage in any way**. Please manage your users through the web interface.

## Service management

Calibre-web runs as its own single process with its own system user.


The systemd service for calibre-web resides here:

```bash
/etc/systemd/system/calibre-web.service
```

You can use the following commands to manage the service.

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="calibre-web"/>

### Verbose output
Calibre-web stores its logs in `/opt/calibre-web/calibre-web.log` and optionally `/opt/calibre-web/access.log`.

You can increase the verbosity of the log level by going to `http://domain.tld/calibre/admin/config`, opening the "Logfile Configuration" section and changing the level there.
